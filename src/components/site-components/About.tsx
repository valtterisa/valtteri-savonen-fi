              I make my own path as an entrepreneur and problem-solver. I love
              jumping into hard challenges that need real smarts to solve. I
              need freedom to experiment and build without limits to really
              shine. I think big, aiming for billions, not millions, with ideas
              that scale worldwide. Engineering lets me turn wild ideas into
              real products that grow fast. Like with builddrr.com, I'm creating
              tools for builders, plus e-commerce hustles that deliver wins.
              It's all about shipping code and products that make an impact.

              I channel my ideas through tech to shake up the old ways and break
              the status quo. I build software for real change, simplifying
              tough tasks and helping people get more done with less effort.
              Dropped out of school to chase this, now shipping AI apps that let
              anyone build Next.js sites quick. From open-source blogs to
              flipping luxury clothes online, I focus on scalable stuff that
              cuts the hassle and makes life easier for everyone.

              My vision is tools that fit seamlessly into daily life, simple yet
              powerful, trusted and used by all. No high costs or barriers, just
              tech that lifts people up and opens the world on a massive scale.
              That's the future I'm building, where my code makes everything
              bigger and better for billions.
